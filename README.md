A collection of scripts to simplify setting up and managing a CozyOS installation, primarily focused on improving developer experience.

## Features

* **Automated Installation:** Streamlines the process of installing CozyOS dependencies and configuring the development environment.
* **Dependency Management:**  Simplifies managing required packages and tools, ensuring a consistent development environment.
* **Configuration:**  Provides options to customize the setup based on your development needs.
* **Utility Scripts:** Includes helpful scripts for common tasks like building, flashing, and debugging CozyOS.

## Requirements

* **Operating System:**  Linux (tested on EndevourOS/Arch Linux) - other distributions may work but are not officially supported yet.
* **Dependencies:**  Specific dependencies will be listed within the installation script and installed automatically.  These may include tools like `git`, `make`, `gcc`, `python`, etc.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CozyOS-SetupTools.git # Replace with the actual repository URL

   ```

2. **Run the Installation Script:**

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh  # or ./install.sh - depends on your script's name
   ```

3. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:** The script will guide you through the installation process, potentially asking for specific configurations or options.


## Usage Examples

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh --all --build
   ```

* **Install only specific dependencies (e.g., build-essential):**

   ```

* **Flash CozyOS to a device (replace /dev/sdX with your device):**
   ```bash
   ./flash.sh /dev/sdX
   ```


## Scripts Included

* **`setup.sh` (or `install.sh`):**  The main installation script.
* **`flash.sh` (example):** A potential script for flashing CozyOS.
* **`build.sh` (example):** A potential script for building CozyOS.

## Configuration

The setup script may support command-line arguments or a configuration file to customize the installation process. Check the script's help message for available options:

```bash
./setup.sh --help
```
